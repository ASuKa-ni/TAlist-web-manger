# TAlist-web-manager
The idea is copy from 黑马程序员 JavaWebClass2024.There make a web app named *tlias web managemen*.
My teacher let us learn there class and make the same app. But I want to make some interesting things.

So, TAlist is its rewrite using htmx and Gin. I'm try to complete all functionality.

In fact, I don't know why their project is named that way. I just wanted this project's name to looks like theirs.
